### Employment 

#### **Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act** [6] [1]

1. [Virginia Career Workers](https://vcwnorthern.com/youth-programs/)
6. [Loudoun County](https://www.loudoun.gov/2377/WIOA---Adult-and-Dislocated-Workers)

  * *US Department of Labor* 
  * *Services for 18-24* 
  * One on one assistance with a WIOA Case Manager
  * Access to career assessments
  * Career Coaching
  * Resume writing
  * Interview preparation
  * Job search assistance
  * Labor Market review
  * Access to education and training options
  * *Need IDs, past school records, Verification of Foster Care or receiving public assistance*
  
I accessed this by searching to Loudoun County Health and Human Services, going to Adult Services-Employment and Education. On this page, there is a link to Workforce Innovation / Opportunity Act Program where I found all of this information and has several links to the National page with videos and how to apply and how to get the applications. 
  
  

#### **Northern Virginia Educating Youth through Employment (EYE) ** [8]

[website](https://vcwnorthern.com/eye-programs/)

  * Summer initiative that recruits, screens and matches youth *ages 18-24* with professional opportunities in the private sector and other area businesses

  * Jobs can include administrative assistant, electrician’s assistant, computer lab /IT
assistant, social media liaison, event planning assistant, among
many other pre-professional opportunities

This seems like a good program but I cannot seem to find the requirements for this or how to apply as a young adult. There are not materials or links that provide additional information than what is above which is mostly just general information. 


#### **Loudoun Workforce Resource Center Community Partners** [5]

[website](https://www.loudoun.gov/3006/Community-Partners)

This page lists all of the county's partners that can help young adults find employment, housing, educational opportunities, etc. This is on the same webste as the WIOA from below under Adult Services-Employment Workforce Resource Center and on the left tab, Community Partners. There are links for every description and is easy to find and use.

I found this page that has all of this information plus contact information and hours that this program is open by going to alleghenycounty.us, Department of Human Services and searching transition age youth. This was the 4th option down. 

  
  
#### **Lifeset** [4]

[website](https://kidsvoice.org/resources/eyJyZXN1bHRfcGFnZSI6InJlc291cmNlcyIsImNoaWxkOnJlc291cmNlX2VudHJ5X2NhdGVnb3J5IjoiMjEifQ#lifeset-programs-for-transition-age-youth-tay)

### Employment 

#### **The Independent Living Initiative** [2]

[website](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=2147493264)

* Enhanced services for *18-24 year olds* that focus on 

  + Career development and job skills
  + Assistance in finances 
  + Assistance in employment, housing and household items 
  + **Funded by Blending Funding** (Chaffee & State Funds) which eliminates waiting lists 
  
From 2008-2009, 32% of the youth using Independent Living Programs 16-21 were pregnant of parenting so in response DHS now sponsors parenting programs for all youths in the program. 

* Partners with *Kidsvoice* in which they co-sponsor a career /college fair for post 18 youths. 


When I searched Allegheny County, PA Transition Age Youth, this was the first link and it automatically downloaded a PDF to my computer with a presentation with all of this information. I did not like this because it was hard for me to know where this information was coming from and to find out more about what they were talking about. 


#### **Auberle’s Employment Institute** [3]

[website](https://www.auberle.org/employment-institute)

* University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) POWRR (Partnership on Workforce Readiness and Retention) community partner
* Offers special classes to help prepare individuals to be hired by UPMC
* Program Offerings: 

  + Career Pathways: 
  
    - Provides *young adults (ages 16-24)* with the skills needed to find employment and build a pathway to a successful career
    - Cannot be enrolled in GED program or High school

* Services: Job readiness training, counseling, GED completion, work experience, education support and tutoring/mentorship, food pantry access, College/Trade School Application Assistance and Tours, Work Attire and Safety Equipment


I found KidsVoice because of the presentation from above so there was not real link from the Allegheny County site. If I hadn't seen KidsVoice on the presentation from above, I would probably not know any of this exists. But the KidsVoice website has a lot of good information and you can search which area you need help with, I selected TAYs and Independent Living and this and the program below showed up and then it links you to some presentations and brochures and other sites with good information with contact information.

I found this document by going to Allegheny County's website and going to Youth and Family Support. Then all the way at the bottom, there is a link that downloads a document of the Allegheny County Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program from April 2020. Reading through this document, I searched key words like foster and then I saw they have a contract with FamilyLink and searched Family Link online. 


#### **Permanent Supportive Housing for Transition Age Youth (TAY) program** [3]

There wasn't too much more information then what is above on how to apply and other requirements but there is contact information at the bottom for more information. I saw ActionHousing on KidsVoice website from when I was looking for education and employmeny programs so I don't think ActionHousing is super popular but if someone knew about the website, it was easy to navigate to what I was looking for.
