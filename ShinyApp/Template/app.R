We expanded their idea of “access to research institutions” to include community colleges, which provide suitable education and job skills for many high-paying occupations. Job skill enhancements can also be made through workforce training sites.  Additionally, high schools can provide important training certificates in computer science, cyber security, and so on."),

This also demonstrates to HGBs that counties have the capacity to train a skilled workforce for new opportunities in high-growth areas, like information technology."),

The ratings are a standardized index (0-100) created from reported importance and scale factors for each occupation.
