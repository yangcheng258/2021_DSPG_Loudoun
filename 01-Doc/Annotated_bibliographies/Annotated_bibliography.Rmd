## Health Outcomes in Young Adults From Foster Care and Economically Diverse Background

Foster youth have a high rate of health problems in their childhood and this study sought to see if their health problems continued and/or increased once they transitioned to adulthood. Three groups were looked at including young adults that were in foster care, those who are economically insecure, and those who come from economically secure backgrounds while concluding that there is certainly an increase in health issues for young adults that were in foster care. The main indicator of the differences in helath issues was access to health care. Adults who were in foster care are most likely to receive Medicaid or have no insurance but also were the least likely to report a health issue. I believe this article is helpful because it provides evidence that young adults aging out of the foster care system are more likely to have chronic illness but not have the ability like insurance to receive aid. This report may also be helpful for future policies on extended insurance or foster care programs that could provide aid for those who have just aged out of the system.

Role models can make a huge impact on a child's future and can help motivate that child to do something with their life. Youth in the foster care either were let down by a parent or guardian or had no choice due to a death or incident and their experience and support in the foster care system affect their adult outcome if they age out of the system. This article examines how adult mentors can ahve a positive influence in adulthood on youth in the foster care system. Mentored youth were less likely to report suicidal ideation, having received a diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection, and having hurt someone in a fight in the past year. They wanted to participate in school or strive for a higher education once they aged out of the system. I think this article is very informative and important to this project because this shows that with a mentor program, the transition aged youth have a more positive outcome compared to those who do not have someone who focuses on them and listens and supports them through their foster care experience.

Housing stability is essential for the transitional aged youth once they are "on their own". In recent years, supportive housing policies and programs have increased but this study shows the real impact of the housing programs now. Though there are programs for this age group who are trying to be more independent and responsible, they are still feeling lost and somewhat held back. With this study, overall 40 young adults were surveyed on their sentiments on the housing program they were support by. Majority of the young adults felt as though they were in a "manchild" phase where they knew they had to be more independent and were living on their own but still needed extra help. Also, they felt that they were being controlled with extensive rules and procedures even though the staff was promoting independence. I believe this article will be helpful with this project because it shows how even with increase housing policies and programs as services for this transitional aged youth, there needs to be the correct amount of rules and expectations of the programs and staff or else the young adults do not feel as they are moving towards their independence and future. 



## A Multi-Level Analysis of the Effects of Independent Living Programs on Educational Attainment, Employment, and Housing Outcomes of Youth Aging Out of Foster Care

This study had many different aspects to it but all these aspects were put together to answer the question: Which Independent Living Programs (ILPs) had the most effect on education, housing and employment? and Why? Young adults who age out of the foster care system and have access to these ILPs had a positive impact on their education attainment, employment status and housing situations but the most influential service provided was services related to education. Post-secondary educational services like SAT prep, counseling about college, information about financial aid and scholarships, help completing college or loan applications, or tutoring while in college had the most impact on all three subjects. But what kept young adults from achieving employment or stable housing or getting a degree was their finances. This study is very important because it shows that young adults are trying to take advantage of these ILPs but their finances limit how much they can do. Also, it provides insights on programs that make the most impact and could be expanded. 



## Transitioning Out of Foster Care: The First 12 Months

This study goes along with the previous articles in which it describes how hard it is for regular teens and young adults to be on their own and aging out of the foster care system is even harder. Many of the subjects who were interviewed concluded that their education goals were the easier to achieve because "it is easier to be a student than an adult" one quoted. While their main struggles came with housing situations due to roommates and lack of money for transportation, technology access and cell phone service. I believe this article will be useful because it gives insights on the main neccessities needed for a young adult to be on their own.

## Homelessness During the Transition From Foster Care to Adulthood
[PDF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969135/pdf/AJPH.2013.301455.pdf)

This study estimates the rate of experienced homelessness among those who age out of the foster care system and determines factors correlated with greater risks of homelessness. The authors find a relatively high rate of homelessness among those who age out of the foster care system, estimating that between 31% and 46% of those who age out of the foster care system had been homeless at least once by age 26. The authors found six factors associated with a higher risk of becoming homeless after aging out of the foster care system: running away while in foster care, frequent placement changes, being male, having a history of physical abuse, engaging in more delinquent behaviors, and having symptoms of a mental health disorder. This article illustrates well the great risk of homelessness that those transitioning out of the foster care system face and shows a need to focus not only on ensuring those leaving the foster care system have a plan for a home after aging out, but a need to focus on those in the foster care system at greatest risk of becoming homeless (i.e. those who run away frequently or those who have mental disorders). However, the authors do little to investigate what programs and approaches have been successful in decreasing homelessness among transition aged youth, particularly among those most likely to become homeless exiting the foster care system. 

## Employment outcomes of young parents who age out of foster care

This study inspects the poor employment outcomes of young parents, both male and female, who age out of the foster care system. The authors found that a large portion of those parents who transition out of the foster care system work infrequently, with nearly 50% of young parents never being employed for the four quarters after the one in which the aged out of the foster care system. Among those who did work, work was infrequent and wages low. Gender differences did not seem to exist regarding the number of quarters worked or total earnings in employed parents. Giving birth at an earlier age and having more children was correlated with lower and less frequent earnings the first four quarters following transitioning out of the foster care system. It was found that employment prior to transitioning out of the foster care system quadrupled employment chances of parents. This article demonstrates well the need for programs targeted not only to reduce unwanted parenthood in foster care programs, but also the need for improved childcare and employment services for foster care youth aging out. Unfortunately, the article has little in the way of analyzing what programs have and have not worked at reducing unwanted parenthood and increasing employment among foster care youth parents.   

## An examination of post-secondary retention and graduation among foster care youth enrolled in a four-year university

This article examines the college drop-out likelihood of former foster care youth as compared to low-income first-generation college students at Michigan State University. The authors determined that former foster care youth, even when controlling for race and gender, were significantly more likely to drop out of college as compared to their low-income first-generation college student counterparts. Drop out rates prior to degree completion were 34% for former foster care youth as compared to 18% for low-income first-generation college students. Reasons for difficulty in attaining a college degree among former foster care students start with issues in primary and secondary education. These issues are claimed to be a result of individual trauma leading to learning disabilities and behavioral problems, difficulties in transferring schools leading and a high concentration of foster care youth in low preforming schools. Listed reasons for withdrawal from college were problems of cost, interruptions in the path to attaining a degree such as transferal and previous withdrawal, inadequate preparation for college in school and poor student services for aged out foster care youth. This article demonstrates the hurdles that former foster care youth face at a time when a college degree is becoming more important than ever for financial stability. However, this article does only focus on one university and extrapolating the findings of this article to all colleges in the U.S. may pose an issue.
